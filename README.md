# ModFr-Normalisation

Automatic normalisation of Early Modern French. This repository contains the scripts and models to reproduce the results of the preprint [Automatic Normalisation of Early Modern French](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03540226). See below for citation instructions.

## Requirements

- Python3 and the requirements specified in `requirements.txt`
- [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) (to train language models for SMT)
- [Moses](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder) (for training and decoding with SMT models)

```
python3 -m venv modfr_env
source modfr_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download and prepare data

### Parallel training data
Get dataset splits:
```
bash data-scripts/get_datasets.sh
```

The final raw files are found in `data/raw/{train,dev,test}/{train,dev,test}.finalised.{src,trg,meta}`.

**What does this do?**

- splitting the files into train/dev/test
- filtering out sentences from the train and dev sets that also appear in the test set and contain over 4 tokens
- normalisation of quotes, apostrophes and repeated spaces

**Subsets of dev and test**

Subsets of dev/test are available in the same subfolders (different data selection scenarios that could be used for separate analysis).

- _1-standard_: "belles-lettres" sentences taken from the same distribution as train (80%/10%/10% train/dev/test)
- _2-test_ ("zero-shot"): selected texts, distributed across periods and genres (0%/0%/100% train/dev/test)
- _3-test+train_ ("few-shot"): selected texts, distributed across periods and genres (10%/0%/90% train/dev/test)
- _4-medecine_ (medical domain): 1 document in the dev and the other in the test (two very different documents) (none in train)
- _5-physique_ (physics/mechanics domain): 1 document in dev and the other in test (none in train)

### Monolingual normalised data (used for some of the language models used for SMT)

Get monolingual normalised data:
```
TODO download data
python data-scripts/get_monolingual_normalised.py <txt_folder> <toc_folder>
bash data-scripts/process_monolingual.sh # to be updated
```


## Normalisation approaches

Below you can find normalisation commands for each of the methods compared. All methods take a text from standard input and output normalised text to standard output. Here, the dev (`data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.src`) is used as an example.

**Rule-based:**

```
cat data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.src | bash norm-scripts/rule-based.sh > outputs/rule-based/dev-1.trg
```


**ABA, alignment-based approach:**

See the github repository: [https://github.com/johnseazer/aba](https://github.com/johnseazer/aba)

**Statistical MT (SMT):**

```
bash norm-scripts/smt_translate.sh <model_folder>
```
E.g.
```
cat data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.src | bash norm-scripts/smt_translate.sh mt-models/best-smt/1/model > outputs/smt/dev/dev-1.trg
```
N.B. If you want to use this script to translate SMT models that have been trained with other segmentations, make sure to change `segtype` in `smt_translate.sh`.


**Neural MT (NMT), both LSTM and Transformer**

```
bash norm-scripts/nmt_translate.sh <model_path>
```
E.g.
```
cat data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.src | bash norm-scripts/nmt_translate.sh mt-models/best-lstm/1/checkpoint_bestwordacc_sym.pt > outputs/lstm/dev/dev-1.trg
cat data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.src | bash norm-scripts/nmt_translate.sh mt-models/best-transformer/1/checkpoint_bestwordacc_sym.pt > outputs/transformer/dev/dev-1.trg
```

**Post-processing using the contemporary French lexicon, the Le*fff* (Sagot, 2009):**

This approach can be applied after any of the other approaches.

```
cat outputs/rule-based/dev-1.pred.trg | bash norm-scripts/lex-postproc.sh > cat outputs/rule-based+lex/dev-1.pred.trg
```
or applied directly after the main approach:
```
cat data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.src | bash norm-scripts/rule-based.sh | bash norm-scripts/lex-postproc.sh > outputs/rule-based+lex/dev-1.pred.trg
```

## Evaluation

### Evaluate with individual metrics

```
bash eval-scripts/bleu.sh <ref_file> <pred_file> fr
bash eval-scripts/chrf.sh <ref_file> <pred_file> fr
python eval-scripts/levenshtein.py <ref_file> <pred_file> -a {ref,pred} (-c <cache_file>)
python eval-scripts/word_acc.py <ref_file> <pred_file> -a {ref,pred,both} (-c <cache_file>)
```
where `-a ref` means that the reference is used as basis for the alignment, `-a pred` that the prediction is used as basis for the alignment, and `-a both` that the average of the two is calculated. An optional cache file destination (format .pickle) can be specified to speed up evaluation when running it several times.

To calculate the average of a metric over several outputs (relevant for different random seeds of the MT approaches):

### Evaluation over multiple metrics

```
bash eval-scripts/eval_detailed.sh <output_folder> <ref_file> (<cache_file>)
```
where `output_folder` is the folder containing prediction files to be included in the evaluation (all files ending in `.trg` will be included for evaluation. E.g.

```
bash eval-scripts/eval_all.sh outputs/rule-based/dev data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.trg outputs/.cache.pickle 

89.50 & 89.60 & 0.00 & 74.26 & 0.91 \\
```

### Detailed evaluation (including on data subsets)

To calculate all evaluation scores, including on subsets of the data (as specified above and in the meta data):
```
bash eval-scripts/eval-all.sh <ref_file> <meta_file> <pred_file> (<cache_file>)
```
E.g.
```
>> bash eval-scripts/eval-all.sh data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.trg data/raw/dev/dev.finalised.meta outputs/rule-based/dev-1.pred.trg outputs/.cache.pickle
>> all,bleu=74.2593 all,chrf=0.90544 all,lev_char=0.0 all,wordacc_r2h0.896 all,wordacc_h2r=0.894 all,wordacc_sym=0.895 1-standard,bleu=73.3256 1-standard,chrf=0.90136 1-standard,lev_char=0.0 1-standard,wordacc_r2h0.892 1-standard,wordacc_h2r=0.891 1-standard,wordacc_sym=0.892 4-medecine-dev,bleu=83.9066 4-medecine-dev,chrf=0.94225 4-medecine-dev,lev_char=0.0 4-medecine-dev,wordacc_r2h0.933 4-medecine-dev,wordacc_h2r=0.929 4-medecine-dev,wordacc_sym=0.931 5-physique-dev,bleu=73.8570 5-physique-dev,chrf=0.90849 5-physique-dev,lev_char=0.0 5-physique-dev,wordacc_r2h0.901 5-physique-dev,wordacc_h2r=0.895 5-physique-dev,wordacc_sym=0.898
```
where `r2h` means that the reference is used as basis for the alignment, `h2r` that the hypothesis is used as basis for the alignment and `sym` means that the mean of the two directions is calculated.

## Retrain the MT models:

### Preprocessing and binarisation

To preprocess with all segmentations used in our experiments, run the following script:

```
bash data-scripts/process_for_mt.sh
```

This involves:

- preparation of data (+ meta information (decades and years))
- subword segmentation using sentencepiece for the following (joint) vocab sizes:
  - char, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 24k
- binarisation of the data in the fairseq format (for neural models)

### Retraining SMT models

#### Training a language model with KenLM

Train all \textit{n}-gram language model combinations as follows:
```
bash mt-training-scripts/train_lms.sh
```
Make sure to change the tool paths in this file first to point to your installation of [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm).

#### Training an SMT model with Moses

An example of a training script is giving in `mt-models/best-smt/1/`. 

To train a new phrase table:
- Create a new model folder (e.g. `mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/1`)
- Copy the train script over: `cp mt-models/best-smt/1/train.sh mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/1/`
- Modify the location of you tools directory `tools=~tools`
- Modify `type=bpe_joint_500` to your chosen segmentation type (e.g. type=bpe_joint_1000)
- Modify the final lines of the two `train-model.perl` commands if you wish to change the type of language model used
- Go to the directory and run training: `cd mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/1; bash train.sh`

Tune the models:
- Copy the tuning script over `cp mt-models/best-smt/1/tune.sh mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/1/`
- As before, modify the tools location and the segmentation type.
- Go to the directory adn run tuning: `cd mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/1; bash tune.sh`

This does tuning for 1 random seed. To do the other two random seeds create two more subfolders `mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/2` and `mt-models/smt-bpe_joint_1000/3`, copy the tuning script over from `1/` as it is and rerun tuning (i.e. you do not need to retrain phrase tables and language models).

### Hyper-parameter searches for LSTM and Transformer models

Create model folders and scripts for different hyper-parameter settings as follows:
```
bash mt-training-scripts/create_experiments.sh
```
N.B. You can change the hyper-parameter values in this file to generate different combinations. The dropout, batch size and learning rate are hard-coded as we only try different combinations for a few experiments.

This script will create a model folder named with the specific parameters. Each folder will have a subfolder indicating the random seed and in each of these folders will be the training script. 
E.g. `mt-models/transformer_char_2enc_2dec_2heads_128embdim_512ff_0.3drop_0.001lr_3000bsz/{1,2,3}/`

To run training:
```
cd <model_folder>/<seed>
bash train.sh
```
Then translate the validation (dev) set for each of the model checkpoints:
```
cd <model_folder>/<seed>
bash translate_val.sh
```
To choose the best checkpoint (using as the criterion symmetrised word accuracy):
```
bash mt-training-scripts/eval_val.sh <model_folder>/<seed>
```
This will produce a validation file `valid.eval` in the subfolder, which records the scores for each of the checkpoints, finds the best scoring checkpoint and copies it over to `checkpoint_bestwordacc_sym.pt`. The translation of the validation set by this best checkpoint is `checkpoint_bestwordacc_sym.pt.valid.postproc`.
